"""Running a detector over a tile set.

The engine does not care what produced a box. It asks for a callable that takes
an image path and returns boxes, which keeps three things possible at once:

* the normal case, an Ultralytics YOLOv8 checkpoint loaded here, once;
* testing without a checkpoint, by passing a stand-in;
* hosting inside DeepEcho, where torch has to live in a subprocess because
  faiss and torch each ship their own libomp and whichever starts second aborts
  the process on macOS. A thin adapter around that worker satisfies this same
  interface, so nothing in the engine changes.

THE INTERFACE
    detector(image_path: Path) -> list[dict]

    Each dict:
        class       str    the model's own class name, verbatim
        confidence  float  0..1
        bbox        list   [x1, y1, x2, y2] in TILE pixel coordinates

    Plus, optionally, a `classes` attribute listing every class the model can
    emit, and a `name` attribute for the export's model field.

Class names are never assumed. Whatever the checkpoint emits is carried through
to the severity lookup, which has its own documented fallback for a class it
has not been taught.

    could not name it, and that is the entire unidentified-object signal. A
    survey run through only one of them is a survey missing half its detectors.

    Pass a single path for one model, or several for all of them. Every box
