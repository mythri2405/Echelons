"""Detections into hotspots, hotspots into a ranked worklist.

A list of two hundred detections is not a decision. A survey team can dive one
place first, and this module decides which place that is.

AGGREGATION
    The survey is divided into a square grid of GRID pixels per side, per
    strip. Every cell holding at least one detection becomes a hotspot. A cell
    is a fixed frame rather than a grown cluster, which means two runs over the
    same data produce the same hotspots in the same order, and a hotspot's
    extent is a known quantity rather than an emergent one.

    The known limitation, stated because it is real: two detections 10 px apart
    but either side of a cell boundary land in different hotspots. Both are
    still reported, both are still ranked, and neither is lost. Raise GRID if
    your objects cluster tighter than the grid resolves.

RANKING
    By total_severity, descending. Not by count.

    Counting would rank a cell holding six tyres above a cell holding one mine,
    which is the exact failure this system exists to avoid. Total severity is
    the sum of class_weight x confidence over the cell, so six tyres at 0.3
    weight contribute less than one mine at 1.0, and the order comes out right
    without anything being special-cased.

DOMINANT CLASS
    Also severity-weighted, for the same reason. The dominant class of a cell
    is the class with the largest summed severity in it, not the class with the
    most boxes. Three pieces of debris beside one mine leaves the mine as the
    dominant class, and the recommended action is the mine's.

IDENTIFIERS
    H001, H002, and so on, assigned after ranking. H001 is always the highest
    priority hotspot in the export, so the id and the rank never disagree.
