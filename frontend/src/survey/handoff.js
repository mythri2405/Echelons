/**
 * The seam between the hazard map and the grounded assistant.
 *
 * THE BOUNDARY, AND WHY IT IS DRAWN HERE
 *
 *   The hazard map answers  WHERE something is and HOW URGENT it is.
 *   The assistant answers   WHAT it is and WHAT IS KNOWN about it.
 *
 * Those are different questions with different evidence and different ways of
 * being wrong. A severity is arithmetic over a detector's output and can be
 * recomputed by hand. A grounded answer is retrieval over a document corpus.
 * Merging them would let a confident sentence raise a priority, or a priority
 * imply a fact, and neither system can support that.
 *
 * So this module contains no retrieval, no prompt and no knowledge. It builds
 * one plain object and hands it over.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A DETECTION RECORD
 *
 * The assistant already accepts a detection record, and a hotspot context
 * would appear to fit through that door: the schema allows extra keys. It must
 * not go that way. The assistant maps object_class onto its own label and then
 * looks severity up in its own table, so the same hotspot would carry one
 * urgency on the map and a different one beside the answer, with nobody able
 * to see both numbers at once.
 *
 * The map owns urgency. So the context travels as its own field, the
 * assistant displays the severity it is given rather than deriving one, and
 * there is exactly one number for a given hotspot anywhere in the product.
 */

/**
 * Build the context object for a hotspot.
 *
 * The first eight fields are the agreed contract with the assistant. The rest
 * are additive and safe to ignore; nothing downstream is required to read them.
 * Every value is copied straight out of export.json and none is recomputed.
