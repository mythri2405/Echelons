Everything runs inside a temporary directory that is deleted on the way out, so
this leaves nothing behind and can be run on a clean clone.

Synthetic strips are generated with numpy: textured seabed, a blank margin that
should be filtered out, and bright targets at planned pixel positions. A stand-
in detector then reports boxes derived from those planned positions, which is
what makes the assertions exact rather than approximate -- the test knows where
every object is and what should happen to it.

WHAT IS CHECKED
    1  the four output files exist and parse
    2  the manifest keeps its required columns, in order
    3  MIN_CONTENT drops the blank margin and keeps the textured seabed
    4  tile names are {strip}_{x}_{y}.jpg and the offsets are real pixels
    5  tiles overlap by TILE - STRIDE
    6  severity is exactly class_weight * confidence, every record
    7  an unlisted class falls back to UNKNOWN_CLASS_SEVERITY
    8  an object in the tile overlap is merged into one detection
    9  two different classes at the same place are NOT merged
   10  merging does not chain along a line of separate objects
   11  provenance survives: source_tiles, merged_count, representative_tile
   12  hotspots are ranked by total_severity, not by count
   13  the dominant class is severity-weighted, not a headcount
   14  ids are H001.. and agree with priority_rank
   15  no navigation means every latitude and longitude is null
   16  four-corner navigation puts every position inside the corners
   17  the export contract has all six blocks and the base keys
   18  no absolute filesystem path leaks into the export
   19  two runs over the same input agree on everything but the clock
