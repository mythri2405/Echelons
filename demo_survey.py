"""The whole pipeline, with no survey and no checkpoint.

    python3 demo_survey.py                 # writes ./demo_out/
    python3 demo_survey.py --out /tmp/demo
    python3 demo_survey.py --geo           # with four-corner navigation

Every stage runs for real: tiling, the manifest, global coordinates, severity,
deduplication, hotspots, ranking, export.json, actions.csv and map.html. The
only simulated part is the two inputs at the very front, the sonar and the
detector, and both are simulated deterministically so the demo is identical
every time it is shown.

NOTHING HERE IS EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING
The output is labelled as synthetic in four independent places, because a
synthetic detection that reads like a real one is worse than no detection at
all: everything downstream treats a record as evidence.

    1  export.json carries  metadata.demo: true, a data_source of
       "SYNTHETIC DEMO DATA", and a demo_warning in words
    2  provenance.demo is true
    3  map.html shows a banner across the top that cannot be dismissed
    4  the run writes to its own directory, defaulting to ./demo_out, and
       refuses to write into a directory that already holds a real export

Point four is the one that matters most. Demo output never lands in the same
directory as real output, so no operator can end up looking at a mixture.
