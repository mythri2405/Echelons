"""The grounded assistant, reached from the API shell.

This was a stub that raised NotImplementedError. The engine it was waiting for
is backend/chat.py: retrieval over the corpus in kb/, generation held to the
grounding rules in rag.py, and citations returned as structured data.

Everything here is a thin call into that engine. No retrieval, no prompting and
no severity logic lives in this file, because duplicating any of it is how the
API and the engine start disagreeing about what the assistant may say.
